This folder contains the week 3 deliverables for Team 2F. For this task, Microsoft Power BI was used as the tool for building the Dashboard.

The "Analysis and plots-1.pbix" is the Power BI file that contains the Interactive Dashboard. Double click on it to open it and it should open automatically if you have Power BI installed on your PC, else you will need to download and install Power BI (Check the Microsoft Store). The Dashboard will work well with Version: 2.111.590.0 64-bit (November 2022) and above.


The other Excel CSV files are the datasets used to build the dashboard.

We also published the dashboard and you can view it using this link:

Please note that you will be required to sign in to Power BI with a Company email and password as Power BI does not accept personal emails. Apart from that, the link is accessible to all.
