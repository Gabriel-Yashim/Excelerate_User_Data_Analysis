Your task for Week 2 is to create a wireframe for the upcoming dashboard. The wireframe should be a visual representation of the key components, headings, and graphs that will be included in the final dashboard. 

Keep in mind the questions the dashboard aims to answer, the preprocessing steps conducted on the dataset, and the potential components of trend and comparative analysis.

Submit a clear image or document containing your hand-drawn or presentation-style wireframe.
Include annotations explaining the purpose of each component and its alignment with the questions and analysis objectives.

This wireframe is a crucial step toward visualizing the structure of the dashboard and ensuring that it effectively communicates insights derived from the datasets. It serves as a guide for the subsequent stages of dashboard development and analysis.
