This folder contains the week 3 deliverables for Team 2F. For this task, Microsoft Power BI was used as the tool for building the Dashboard.

The "Analysis and plots-1.pbix" is the Power BI file that contains the Interactive Dashboard. The other Excel CSV files are the datasets used to build the dashboard.

We also published the dashboard and you can view it using this link:
